! Platform: Any Pick; Any OS; Any Emulator; Any Emulation

! Function: Defines ANY_KEY's replacement key-codes, with which  you  can
!           grant your programs the ability to react to  any/all  special
!           keys offered by the terminal currently  being  emulated,  and
!           that without impacting  any  other  existing  programs.  (And
!           wouldn't your users really prefer software that behaves  like
!           all the rest of the more modern software extant,  using,  for
!           example, the page-down key to see that  next  page  of  data,
!           instead of having to press N and Enter?)  (Or was that N2 and
!           then Enter?)  You can even eliminate that wasted line of text
!           reminding users just which archaic,  non-intuitive  keys  are
!           expected on that particular screen.

!           Regular keys are returned  individually,  and  unaltered,  so
!           they are not defined here or anywhere else in this suite.

!           All equates adhere to the following naming-convention:
!           K - all key equates begin with K for Key.
!           P - indicates a keypad-key was pressed.
!           M - indicates that a mouse-key was pressed.
!           S - indicates that the key is modified by Shift.
!           C - indicates that the key is modified by Control/Ctrl.
!           A - indicates that the key is modified by Alt(ernate).
!           _ - separates the modifiers from the key cap/name.
!           Keyname - A, B, C, HOME, END, TAB, etc.

!           Thus Ctrl+A equates to KC_A, and Shift+Ctrl+Home  equates  to
!           KSC_HOME.

!           Symbol keys, like ! & *, which cannot be used in variable  or
!           equate names are assigned long names, such as BANG and  STAR.
!           Thus Alt+! equates to KA_BANG, and Alt+* equates to KA_STAR.

!           The aim here is not only to give new programs features  users
!           have come  to  expect  from  modern  software,  but  also  to
!           simplify the task of updating older programs, and to do  both
!           without disrupting any existing,  unmodified  programs,  and,
!           furthermore, to work the same on all flavors, in  all  flavor
!           and terminal emulations; truly Write Once Run Anywhere.

!           Works with ANY_KEY_TBL and ANY_KEY to translate  most  termi-
!           nals'/emulators'  special  keys  into  the  two-char  strings
!           defined below.

!           ANY_KEY_TST is also part of the  suite.  Using  it,  you  can
!           test your specific terminal/emulator, and identify any as yet
!           undefined keys to be added  to  ANY_KEY_TBL,  or  perhaps  to
!           correct any that I've got wrong.

!           ANY_KEY_NUM automatically  resequences/renumbers  ANY_KEY_EQU
!           and ANY_KEY_TBL for you, in case you need to  add  or  remove
!           any definitions to/from either of them.

!           Any emulator can, by the way, be distinguished by ANY_KEY via
!           SYSTEM(7) without resorting  to  trying  a  series  of  self-
!           identification codes (which can disrupt the  display)  simply
!           by copying an existing driver to a  new  name.  For  example,
!           where CMD.EXE is desired for connecting to a linux  host,  it
!           would be beneficial to copy the host's linux terminal  driver
!           to a new name, say, ntc or dosbox, and, then, configure  that
!           port/user to specify that new terminal definition upon login.
!           This allows you to add  an  entire  CMD.EXE-specific  set  of
!           codes to ANY_KEY_TBL.  (Actually, I've already done that.)

!           Key code sequences are stored in ANY_KEY_TBL instead of in  a
!           file for simplicity's sake when installing, but it  would  be
!           easy to write the list(s) to a file, and then read it in from
!           that file, bypassing the subroutine call, should such  behav-
!           ior become desirable.

!           A word on emulators ...

!           AccuTerm is the gold standard.  Full stop.  There are others,
!           like PassPort, which are nearly  as  configurable,  but  only
!           nearly, and nowhere near as powerful, lacking AccuTerm's  VBA
!           scripting, dialog-boxes, a full GUI, its host  reprogrammable
!           keyboard, and, a feature I really love  and  use,  capture-to
!           and paste-from.  Conversely, PuTTY is less configurable.  But
!           like Windows' CMD.EXE, it has the advantage of having most of
!           its keys enabled.  This means that, where AccuTerm faithfully
!           emulates the terminals in its palette, limiting the  keys  to
!           their  unmodified  forms  (no  Ctrl+Home  or  Alt+F),  PuTTY,
!           CMD.EXE, gnome-terminal, xterm, etc.,  while  all  ostensibly
!           VTxxx compatible, also allow every combination of special key
!           and modifiers (i.e.: Ctrl+Shift+F1).  This  alone  makes them
!           powerful alternatives to AccuTerm, in a pinch, such as  where
!           AccuTerm can't be  installed  (Linux/Apple),  but  AccuTerm's
!           still greater configurability allows all the 'dead'  keys  to
!           be enabled, no matter which emulation  is  used.  To  exploit
!           this feature more fully, I've  additionally  created  a  text
!           file of key definitions that can be inserted into an AccuTerm
!           .atcf file to bestow upon any terminal emulation all the keys
!           and modifiers expected of software today.  Moreover, this  is
!           accomplished by simply  using  the  code-sequences  of  other
!           emulators/terminals.  For example, using my  preferred  vt320
!           emulation, the navigation and function keys are very  limited
!           compared to say xterm.  But, using AccuTerm's key-programming
!           screen, I mapped all those key-combinations absent from vt320
!           to those generated by xterm, making the full spectrum of key-
!           strokes available  to  my  programs,  all  while  maintaining
!           complete compatibility with TCL and the  shell,  as  well  as
!           with any existing programs on  the  system  containing  hard-
!           coded VT key-sequences.

!           If, however, AccuTerm, or anything else with  a  programmable
!           keyboard, is not an option, and the only  emulator  available
!           to you, like CMD.EXE, lacks some key you really want/need (on
!           CMD.EXE tab and shift-tab both generate CHAR(9), so shift-tab
!           is unavailable), then just use ANY_KEY_TST to identify a key-
!           combination that is available to you, but which might not  be
!           needed, and  can  then  be  pressed  into  service  elsewhere
!           instead.  For example, to compensate for the lack of  shift+-
!           tab on CMD.EXE, you could employ, say  ctrl+backspace,  which
!           is available.

!           Just include this in any program, CALL ANY_KEY, and  use  the
!           following equate names to detect  and  react  to  the  user's
!           input as shown in the example below.

!           Omit any unnecessary/undesirable keys.

! Examples: INCLUDE ANY_KEY_EQU

!           LOOP

!              CALL ANY_KEY( TEXT_KEY, META_KEY )

!              BEGIN CASE

!                 CASE META_KEY EQ KC_HOME     ; GOSUB JUMP.TO.TOP
!                 CASE META_KEY EQ KC_END      ; GOSUB JUMP.TO.END
!                 CASE META_KEY EQ K_PAGE_UP   ; GOSUB PAGE.UP

!                 CASE META_KEY EQ K_DELETE    ; GOSUB DELETE.RGT

   COM /ANY_KEY/ ANY_KEYS( 13 ) ;! UD rejects common names over 7 chars

   PROMPT ''

   ! Why these characters?  (!", !$, !%, etc.)  Because it would be  next
   ! to impossible for a user to enter any of these pairs fast enough  to
   ! fool the system into thinking that a special key had  been  pressed.
   ! Also, these 21 characters  allow  enough  permutations  to  uniquely
   ! identify almost 400 key-combinations with only 2  characters.  More-
   ! over, using regular chars (ASCII 33-126) in simple strings sidesteps
   ! any problems with EQU TO  things like  CHAR( 27 ) : CHAR( 127 ),  as
   ! is the case with D3.  (Or at least it was last time I used it.)
